                <p> "Imagine flying through the sky like that. Can you see it little buddy?... We just have
					to keep dreaming. We just have to keep believing. Soon I'll take you from all this pain
					and I'll build you a kingdom of your own. You will be a king. I promise. Even if it
					kills me to do it, I will make you a king. Just stay with me for a little longer. Don't

					then shone down over the horizon. It's light crept across the elders body slowly incasing him
					in stone. The younger screamed, "NO!!!" as he saw a smile creep over the elder's face, and a look of relief.
					"Keep pushing brother... Your nearly there. I'm so proud of you... I'll.. be... watching..."</p>
